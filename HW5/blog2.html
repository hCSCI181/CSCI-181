  <h2>5 Lessons You'll Learn on the Road</h2>
  <p>Travel can be a life-altering experience, even more so when it is done solo or with ample time to reflect. Here are 5 lessons that we learned from living a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Solo time is essential:</b><br>Taking time for oneself is essential to living a productive lifestyle. After traveling solo, I had a better idea of my needs and desires thanks to the time I took to reflect while traveling.</li>
    <li><b>Mistakes and breakdowns are part of the journey:</b><br>When beginning to travel, a lot of us try to do everything above and beyond our power to make sure everything goes <em>just</em> right. What we learned on the road is that hiccups in travel are an inevitable part of the journey and are such a valuable learning experiecence. </li>
    <li><b>You don't need all the perfect gear:</b><br>A lot of time travel of all kinds (van travel, globtrotting, thru-hiking, backpacking, and more) are few as elitist activities that can only be done by those who have all the best gear. But, in reality, we learned that a simple $20 cooler from Walmart worked just as well as a $1000 fridge installed in a van home and that a simple camera captures priceless moments just as well as a professional grade Nikon. If you don't have all the "right" gear, just go!</li>
    <li><b>Friendships are invaluable:</b><br>The friendships you'll make on the road will make the journey 100x better. Be open to new friendships and stay curious. It's likely you'll meet friends for life while traveling</li>
    <li><b>You are your best friend:</b><br>Living on the road often means living alone. This means that you'll be relying solely on yourself for all your needs and entertainment at times. Enjoy yourself. On the road, you'll learn that you are you own best friend.</li>
