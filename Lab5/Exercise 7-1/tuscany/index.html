<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="photopages/countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="Country side scenery" width="75" height="100"></a>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>The Streets of Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="photopages/sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="Streets of a historic city with old brick buildings" width="75" height="100"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="Towering historic cathedral with tourists mingling outside" width="75" height="100"></a>This historic cathedral was one of our favorite sights. We spent hours marveling the beauty of its architecture before heading to a restaurant for a hearty spaghetti dinner.</p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="Row of purple lavender flowers growing in front of a building" width="75" height="100"></a>I was amazed to see how plentiful lavender was in Italy. It seemed to be everywhere we went. I love the pop of color it brings to this photo.</p>

<h2>Delicious Sweets</h2>
<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="Bakery case full of pastries" width="100" height="75"></a>During our time in Italy, we visited many bakeries. The pastries were delicious. Plus, spending the morning sipping coffee and sampling pastries turned out to be an excellent way to get to know the locals.</p>
