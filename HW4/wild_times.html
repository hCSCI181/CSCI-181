<p>The Wild Times Summer Camp is <em>the ultimate</em> summer adventure camp for those who like spending their days in the wild and getting dirty.

You'll learn how to build fires, practice Leave No Trace (LNT) principles, identify plants, trees, birds, and other animals that live in Montana. During this week long camp, you'll also make close friendships with other rad people and learn from one another. Join us for a awe-inspiring and fun time! Bring your sunscreen, young folks!</p>
