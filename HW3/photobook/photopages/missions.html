<h1>Turquoise Lake</h1>
<p>During July, I attempted backpacking into Turquoise lake in the Mission Mountains. Although the lake was snowed in still, it was a beautiful hike. We camped at a lower elevation lake instead. If you're interested in visiting this amazing place, check out <a href="http://www.backpacker.com/trips/hidden-montana-mission-mountains"> Backpacker Magazine's article</a> for more information and directions to the trailhead.</p>
